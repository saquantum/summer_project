Frequent lightning, hail and strong, gusty winds will be additional hazards.\n\nWhat Should I Do?\n\nConsider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. \n\nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.\n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\n\nIf you find yourself outside and hear thunder, protect yourself by finding a safe enclosed shelter (such as a car). Do not shelter under or near trees, or other structures which may be struck by lightning. If you are on an elevated area move to lower ground.\n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.",
