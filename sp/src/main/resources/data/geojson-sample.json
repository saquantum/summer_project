Frequent lightning, hail and strong, gusty winds will be additional hazards.\n\nWhat Should I Do?\n\nConsider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. \n\nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and train timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.\n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; consider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\n\nIf you find yourself outside and hear thunder, protect yourself by finding a safe enclosed shelter (such as a car). Do not shelter under or near trees, or other structures which may be struck by lightning. If you are on an elevated area move to lower ground.\n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met Office recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.",

          "warningFurtherDetails" : "Heavy showers and some thunderstorms are expected to develop across parts of southeast Scotland and northeast England on Wednesday, clearing east into the North Sea later in the afternoon. Whilst some places may see relatively small amounts of rainfall, a few locations could see 15-20 mm of rain in an hour or less leading to some impacts from surface water flooding. Where several showers move over the same area, there is a chance of 20-30 mm falling in 2-3 hours.\n\nAs the showers clear to the east strong winds may develop on the western flank with gusts of around 40 mph possible for a short period of time.\n\nWhat Should I Do?\n\nConsider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an \nemergency flood kit. \n\nGive yourself the best chance of avoiding delays by checking road conditions if driving, or bus and \ntrain timetables, amending your travel plans if necessary.\n\nPeople cope better with power cuts when they have prepared for them in advance. Itâ€™s easy to do; \nconsider gathering torches and batteries, a mobile phone power pack and other essential items.\n\nIf you find yourself outside and hear thunder, protect yourself by finding a safe enclosed shelter \n(such as a car). Do not shelter under or near trees, or other structures which may be struck by \nlightning. If you are on an elevated area move to lower ground.\n\nBe prepared for weather warnings to change quickly: when a weather warning is issued, the Met \nOffice recommends staying up to date with the weather forecast in your area.",
