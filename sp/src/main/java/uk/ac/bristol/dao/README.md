This packages stores data-accessing interfaces which will be proxied by MyBatis. For every method in this package, you should be able to find an ORM under `uk.ac.bristol.dao.PostgreSQLMapper.xml`. For example, for the method `List<AssetHolder> selectAllAssetHolders()`, there is a configuration `<select id="selectAllAssetHolders" resultMap="AssetHolderMap"> select * from asset_holders </select>` that also explains its SQL statement.
